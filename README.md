# Refactor App / Code Editor / IDE

# Server Client App for Linux
### The project was created with a small team at university during laboratory work, so sorry for the bad namings of variables/functions/classes, etc. Everybody was doing only their part, mostly.
## Abstract
Welcome to the custom code editor project, a labor of me and my small university team where we've designed a tool to streamline the coding experience.

Features:
- Variable Rename;
- Method Rename;
- Word Rename;
- Method Extraction: Extract reusable blocks of code into new functions seamlessly. Take a snippet of code, and my editor creates a new method with the selected code, promoting modular and cleaner coding practices.
